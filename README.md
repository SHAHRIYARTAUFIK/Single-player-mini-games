1) **Tile Match** takes a different approach as a strategic swapping puzzle where you click on two adjacent colored tiles to swap their positions. The objective is to create lines of three or more matching colors, which automatically disappear and award you points. When tiles disappear, the remaining tiles fall down due to gravity, and new random tiles appear at the top, potentially creating new matching opportunities. The challenge lies in thinking ahead to set up multiple matches in sequence, as each swap counts as a move and you want to maximize your score efficiency by creating combinations that trigger satisfying cascading eliminations across the board.
