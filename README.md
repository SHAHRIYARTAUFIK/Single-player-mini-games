This a single player game setup made by me and designed by me i hope you  would enjoy
1) **Tile Match** takes a different approach as a strategic swapping puzzle where you click on two adjacent colored tiles to swap their positions. The objective is to create lines of three or more matching colors, which automatically disappear and award you points. When tiles disappear, the remaining tiles fall down due to gravity, and new random tiles appear at the top, potentially creating new matching opportunities. The challenge lies in thinking ahead to set up multiple matches in sequence, as each swap counts as a move and you want to maximize your score efficiency by creating combinations that trigger satisfying cascading eliminations across the board.
2) **Color Chain Reaction** is an explosive energy-building game where you click on colorful orbs to charge them up with energy. The magic happens when an orb reaches maximum energy - it explodes and spreads that energy to all nearby orbs of the same color, creating incredible chain reactions that can cascade across the entire board! Your goal is to strategically trigger these chain explosions to reach target scores within a limited number of moves. Each level gets more challenging by requiring higher scores while giving you fewer moves, so you need to think carefully about where to click to create the biggest, most spectacular chain reactions possible.
